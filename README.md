# Version control is important for several reasons. 
# If a change to the code is made but causes bugs version control allows the programmers to revert back to a version that was functional. 
# Version control is also vital to collaboration. If the project is very large multiple programmers will need to work on the project simultaneously. When multiple programmers are working on different parts they will need to merge their code without missing anything. 
# Version control insures that code will be merged without any code being lost. Version control also makes it faster to merge code as opposed to copy-pasting it. 
# Version control employs a feature where only one programmer can update the code at one time. This insures that if two programmers update the same line that there will not be errors related to what the line will be changed to. Version control also keeps track of who makes changes to the code to increase accountability.
